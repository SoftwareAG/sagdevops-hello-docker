# Command Central Docker images

## Create subscription on Docker Store

* Login to [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) with your Docker ID
* Open [Command Central product](https://store.docker.com/images/softwareag-commandcentral)
* `Checkout`, accept the license agreement to get access to Command Central images

## Preparation

Login to Docker with your Docker ID on the target machine and verify you can download the images
from the Docker Store:

```bash
docker login
docker pull store/softwareag/commandcentral-client:10.3
```

## Using docker-compose to stand up basic dev or test environment

> IMPORTANT: Empower SDC credentials are required to register product and fix repositories

Run example init service from [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file:

On Linux, Mac

```bash
export EMPOWER_USR=you@company.com
export EMPOWER_PSW=****
export CC_PASSWORD=****

docker-compose run --rm init
...
INIT SUCCESSFUL
```

On Windows:

```shell
set EMPOWER_USR=you@company.com
set EMPOWER_PSW=****
set CC_PASSWORD=****

docker-compose run --rm init
...
INIT SUCCESSFUL
```

The above command will:

* Create and start Command Central container
* Create, start and register a test managed node as `node1` alias
* Register master `products` and `fixes` repositories using provided Empower credentials
* Verify `node1` and repositories are registed and accessible

> NOTE: Command Central container (`cc` service) performs all the initialization on its own. The `init` service is run for verification purpose only.

When the above command successfully completes, open [Command Central Web UI](https://0.0.0.0:8091)
and login as Administrator and `CC_PASSWORD`.

## Persistance

Command Central container uses named volumes for persisting data and configuration. You can list the created volumes
using `docker volume ls` command:

```bash
docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               sagdevops-cc-server_cce_conf
local               sagdevops-cc-server_cce_data
local               sagdevops-cc-server_spm_conf
local               sagdevops-cc-server_spm_data
```

Any changes you make within Command Central container are peristed in these volumes.
The containers can be completely destroyed, recreated, upgraded and the configuration and data will be preserved.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check status of the containers by running `docker-compose ps` command

If `cc` service has exited with exit code 100, this means the initialization of the Command Central container has failed

2. Check the Command Central container logs by running `docker-compose logs cc` command.

If the failed initialization refers to repository connectivity error, double check that you provided valid Empower credentials
using `EMPOWER_USR` and `EMPOWER_PSW`

## Developing templates and Dockerizing your applications

Please see [Software AG DevOps Templates](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-templates) project
for details on how use default Command Central templates for template-based provisioning, customize them
and create your own templates, as well as build default and custom Docker images for your applications.

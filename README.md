# Command Central Docker images

## Create subscription on Docker Store

* Login to Docker Store with your Docker ID
* Open https://store.docker.com/images/softwareag-commandcentral
* `Checkout` and accept license agreement to get access

## Preparation

Login to Docker with your Docker ID from your console and verify you can download the images:

```bash
docker login
docker pull store/softwareag/commandcentral-client:10.3
```

## Using docker-compose to standup basic dev or test environment

Run example init service from `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
export EMPOWER_USR=you@company.com
export EMPOWER_PSW=****
export CC_PASSWORD=****

docker-compose run --rm init
```

The above command will:

* Create and start Command Central container
* Create, start and register a test managed node as `node1`
* Register master product and fix repositories with provided Empower credentials
* Verify `node1` and repositories are registed and accessible

When it's done running open [Command Central Web UI](https://0.0.0.0:8091)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-hello-docker.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-hello-docker)

# Command Central Docker images

## Create subscription on Docker Store

* Login to [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) with your Docker ID
* Open [Command Central product](https://store.docker.com/images/softwareag-commandcentral)
* `Checkout`, accept the license agreement to get access to Command Central images

## Preparation

Login to Docker with your Docker ID on the target machine and verify you can download the images
from the Docker Store:

```bash
docker login
docker pull store/softwareag/commandcentral-client:10.3
```

## Using docker-compose to standup basic dev or test environment

> IMPORTANT: Empower SDC credentials are required to register product and fix repositories

Run example init service from [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file:

```bash
export EMPOWER_USR=you@company.com
export EMPOWER_PSW=****
export CC_PASSWORD=****

docker-compose run --rm init
```

The above command will:

* Create and start Command Central container
* Create, start and register a test managed node as `node1` alias
* Register master `products` and `fixes` repositories using provided Empower credentials
* Verify `node1` and repositories are registed and accessible

When the above command successfully completes, open [Command Central Web UI](https://0.0.0.0:8091)
and login as Administrator and `CC_PASSWORD` that you used.

## Developing templates and Dockerizing your applications

Please see [Software AG DevOps Templates](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/sagdevops-templates) project
for details on how use default Command Central templates for template-based provisioning, customize them
and create your own templates, as well as build default and custom Docker images for your applications.
